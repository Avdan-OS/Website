          We are simply doing a Desktop Environment. But don’t get too mad, we don’t need more than that. We do not need to code or package a whole OS.

          > **Linux package =** “package” refers to a **compressed file archive containing all of the files that come with a particular application**. The files are usually stored in the package according to their relative installation paths on your system. Most packages also contain installation instructions for the OS, as well as a list of any other packages that are dependencies (prerequisites required for installation.

          🧠 This means that we will need to simply just make a desktop environment and package it. Linux will figure it out.

          There is a **huge misconception that the UI you see when you use a particular OS is the OS itself**. It is not. Those are 2 completely different things. The **OS** is what *screws around with all the hardware* you have (i.e. the Kernel and the System Programs). The **applications** (Application Programs to be precise) that you use, including the desktop UI *is not a part of the operating system*.

          🧠 We will also write a **Wayland Compositor [The Wayland Compositor ](https://www.notion.so/The-Wayland-Compositor-d50267f916ae4592bfe9a3340e5472f1)** to allow for the custom features and behaviour we want to take place. It will be made using **Rust** and [**Smithay**](https://smithay.github.io/) to add additional Features to the Desktop Environment.
