# TabOS: OS stands for Operating System so the acronym should be capitalised
TabOS!:
Browsers have proven how powerful tabs are, so why not use them to make your os even more powerful?:

We give you control over your system. Theme is just an important one of them, and you can get more if you don't like ours.:
