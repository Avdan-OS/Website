familiar dock, ultimate form:

overpowered dock:
your dock can do more than ever. it's your ultimate manager to get you organised.:
new way to manage files:

drag & drop made easy:
drag and drop is the easiest way to transfer anything on your computer. we make it intuitive and easy to use.:
more than multitask:
want to do many tasks at a time? we know you and we got you. it's now not only multitasking, it's organised multitasking.:
tabos!:
browsers have proven how powerful tabs are, so why not use them to make your os even more powerful?:
new context menu:
context menu didn't change for multiple decades now. we are tired of a long list of items, and hey why not make it a circle? don't like it? you can switch it back in settings!:
your os, your preference:
we give you control over your system. theme is just an important one of them, and you can get more if you don't like ours.:
day & night:
let different themes tell you what time it is. hey, you can even make it reversed. can you do it on windows or macos?:
