        ### Before you start

        **Are you looking for development help?**
        â†© Please note that we cannot provide assistance on web development. We recommend asking around on a dedicated help forum like StackOverflow.

        **Is your issue about content on an MDN page besides the compatibility table?**
        â†© Use the _Report a problem with this content on GitHub_ link at the bottom of the page.

        **Need help with a browser?**
        ðŸ™‹ To get help with [Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/file-bug-report-or-feature-request-mozilla), [Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95315?hl=en-GB&ref_topic=7439544), [Safari](https://www.apple.com/feedback/safari.html), or another browser, check the browser's support site.

        ### Issue etiquette

        When opening an issue, please:
        - Follow the project's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) as well as the [GitHub Community Guidelines](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines). Failure to comply may result in exclusion from MDN Web Docs and/or GitHub.
        - Check for an [existing issue](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/issues) first. If someone else has opened an issue describing the same problem, please upvote their issue rather than creating another one.
        - Keep issues relevant to the project. Irrelevant issues will be automatically closed and marked as spam, and repeated offenses may result in exclusion from MDN Web Docs.
        - Provide as much detail as possible. The more detail you are able to provide, the better!
        - Write issues primarily in English. While translation tools are available, we will be able to provide better assistance with pre-translated content. You are more than welcome to include a version of the issue body in your preferred language alongside the English version.
